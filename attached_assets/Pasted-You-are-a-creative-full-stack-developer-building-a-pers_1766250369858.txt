You are a creative full-stack developer building a personal demo app for tracking DSA + interview preparation.
This is a vibe-coding project, not production.
Prioritize clarity, speed, and visuals over completeness.

🎯 Goal of the Demo

Build a clean, satisfying tracker app that:

Feels motivating to open daily

Lets me tick progress easily

Shows visible momentum (streaks, progress bars)

Works fully in demo mode (local data only)

No auth. No backend. No complexity.

🧩 Core Demo Features (KEEP IT SMALL)
1️⃣ Home Dashboard (Main Vibe Screen)

Show:

🔥 Daily streak counter

📊 Overall DSA progress %

🟩 Progress bars for:

Sorting

Binary Search

Recursion

Linked List

Stack & Queue

Trees

Heaps

Hashing

DP

Arrays (last)

Use dummy starter data.

2️⃣ DSA Checklist Page

For each topic:

Expandable card

Checklist of subtopics

Status color:

Green = done

No reminders. No dates. Just vibes.

3️⃣ Daily Tracker Page
